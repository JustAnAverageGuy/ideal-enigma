TODO stuff here, apart from unsolved challenges

# Visualisations
- Create a visualisation for Day 2,
    - Highlight valid chararcters and gray out (dim out) the characters irrelevant to the match
- Create a visualisation for Day 6,
    - The tree grows like this

    ```
    - At each step, draw only a layer of the tree. Pre allocate the number of leaves lines for the drawing, no need to separate all children from the line, may continue one child as the main line, on the same line
- Create visualisation for Day 8
    - I imagine plot (maybe histogram, or some sort of stacked stuff, idk, figure it out) mulitple bug types with matplotlib and use the animate method

- Create visualisation for Day 5
    - Pretty straightforward
